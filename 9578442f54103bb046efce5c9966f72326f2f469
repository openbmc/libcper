      "message": "Is it possible to make this code correct regardless of the compiler mode?  I assume comparing against something in limits.h or ifdefing in the check would work?\n\nFWIW, this check could also be improved to check for true ascii characters, rather than just checking for \u003e 0\n\nI would prefer to avoid enforcing certain compiler flags if possible.  If not, this patch is probably fine",
