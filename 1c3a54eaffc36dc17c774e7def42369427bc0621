      "message": "Hi Patric, I tried to update the code as your comments.\n\nAs the libpldm, I have to move all of the installed header files `include/libcper`. The libcper `meson.build` will include that folder as include dir.\nThis allows the `libcper` source files can use the header files in `include/libcper` when the header files are not installed to `/usr/include` directory.\n\nI wonder do we have any way without require moving the header file to `include/libcper`?",
